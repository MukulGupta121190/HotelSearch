🏨 Hotel Search Assistant | Gen AI Capstone Project

🔍 Problem Statement and Use Case

Planning travel accommodations is time-consuming and often frustrating:

🔄 Users need to visit multiple hotel booking sites.

📅 They must manually input dates, locations, and preferences repeatedly

🤯 Comparing options across different platforms is inefficient and frustrating

❌ Natural language queries (like "Find hotels in Goa for next weekend") aren't supported by most booking sites.


How Gen AI Solves this:
This project creates an AI-powered hotel search assistant that:

1. Understands natural language - Interprets casual requests like "Find 3-star hotels in Mumbai from May 5 to May 7 for 2 adults"
2. Automates search - Programmatically constructs and executes hotel search queries
3. Summarizes results - Extracts and presents key information (prices, ratings, amenities) clearly
4. Saves time - Reduces multiple manual steps to a single conversational interaction
